What i made ?

I made landing page - Registeration - Login 
---------------------------------------

what I use ?

I used Angular which depend on typescript to allow using single page Application

so i used typescript to router page and in authentication with api also to make array of object to make design easily.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it responsive for less size of page ?

not totally because ui/ux didn't make it.
-------------------------------------------------------

why i didn't continue the project?

beacuse ui/ux give me screens late so i had to finish landing page and to link with apis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code contain components:
Home (Landing page)  contain navbar and navigate to each section in it
Login Screen which return back to home that's is n't too much true because it must move to page of wallete but to see that is work so i made that.
SignUp it work that everything is true navigate to loginscreen.


In signup data not made by ui/ux so i made the data what made in api

also I used auth service to link api and retrive data and save current user

used HTML , CSS , TYPSCRIPT 

Note there is some change in bakgroud and sizes but it was made very late.
